            We welcome you to join us as a member of Worldcon 75! Members who join before January of 2017 may nominate for the Hugo Awards, whether they are attending or supporting members. A non-attending membership is also known as a 'supporting membership.'

            Membership payment is currently available on our Holvi store, via Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Diners Club International, JCB and Finnish online bank services. We intend to have a PayPal option up soon, although it may take several weeks. We apologize for the delay.

                People who voted in Worldcon site selection in 2015 (administered by <a href="http://www.sasquan.org/" target="_blank">Sasquan</a>) have, at minimum, an automatic supporting membership to Worldcon 75. This entitles you to a discounted attending membership if you wish to upgrade to attending our convention. See the column above titled 'I Voted'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Friends and subscribers of the <a href="http://www.helsinkiin2017.org/" target="_blank">Helsinki in 2017 Worldcon bid</a> who voted on site selection in 2015 are automatic full attending members of Worldcon 75. This is regardless of how you voted, and we appreciate each of the 2624 people who participated in the vote! If you were a friend or subscriber who didn't manage to vote, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@@worldcon.fi" target="_top">info@@worldcon.fi</a> to discuss.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pre-supporters of the Helsinki in 2017 Worldcon bid are very much appreciated, but the 20 euros of pre-support was entirely used up by the bid's efforts to win the race. We regret that we are not able to offer you a discount for pre-supporting the bid. However, your reward is that we've won the Worldcon to be placed in Helsinki! If you voted on site selection in 2015,  you do have an automatic non-attending (supporting) membership to Worldcon 75. This can be upgraded to an attending membership as above.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to receive paper copies of the convention's publications, we'll be happy to send those to you for an additional â‚¬10 / $12 fee. Our convention default is to receive your pre-convention publications at no additional charge via email or download from this website.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to begin an installment plan for an attending membership, please purchase a supporting membership at this time and email <a href="mailto:registration@@worldcon.fi?Subject=Installment" target="_top">registration@@worldcon.fi</a> with "Installment" in the subject header.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your membership is personal, but it is possible to transfer your membership (of any kind) to another person. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:registration@@worldcon.fi" target="_top">registration@@worldcon.fi</a> if you wish to do this. The type of membership will be retained -- child membership for children only, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                All membership rates which are age-bound refer to a person's age on the first day of the convention, 9 August 2017. Although a Kid-in-Tow is free of charge, please remember to register your wee ones as members. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Child and Kid-in-Tow memberships do not include voting rights. It is possible to buy a membership that is for an older age group, however, if you are under 16 but want to have voting rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                We intend to have day memberships available, if you can't join us for all 5 days but wish to pop in for a day or two. The prices will be published in 2017.
